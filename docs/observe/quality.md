# Go verification and release quality

Use [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for exact commands and
[DESIGN.md sections 21–23](../../DESIGN.md#21-validation-and-cost-contract) for
acceptance criteria. ARM64 is the active target; AMD64 remains unverified.

## Fast feedback

`./scripts/check architecture` enforces production package dependencies without
loading the native driver. `./scripts/check unit` includes architecture checks,
Go unit tests/vet and repository layout/hash checks. `./scripts/check focused
<package> [go test flags]` runs one approved pure-Go package. `./scripts/check
journal-bench` measures streaming journal allocation/time on the current host;
allocations are not a claim about Linux peak RSS.

Use `./scripts/check sdk` for pinned offline and live SDK contracts. Use
`./scripts/check integration` for disposable PostgreSQL/MinIO schema and S3
contracts. `./scripts/check contracts` executes pinned DuckDB 2.0 on Linux ARM64.
Never run the bundled 1.5 engine to avoid the native build. Native dependencies
are isolated in a reusable Docker build layer; pure Go changes use focused checks.

## Durability and resources

Required crash tests use a parent-owned ACK oracle, IPC failpoint barriers,
SIGKILL, restart and exact restored record/receipt comparison. Panic-only and
mock storage tests do not prove durable ACK. Use real PostgreSQL transactions
and owned temporary S3 prefixes. A missing environment/skip is not a passing gate.

Measure wire buffers, decoded object graphs, projections, compression scratch,
spool/cache/spill and native allocations. Permits follow the allocation owner;
cancellation cannot free resources still used by a worker. Test drain, failed
upload, interrupted commit, expired owner and generation changes. Combined-role
budgets must account for the entire process group. Measure Linux cgroup peak and
OOM behavior; Go allocation benchmarks cannot establish the 512 MiB target.

Report accepted and published counts separately, small-file distribution, PG
lock waits and WAL growth, S3 calls/bytes, cold/warm query latency, backup/WAL age
and blocked lanes. Include all PG/S3 costs in whole-installation comparisons.

The Q5 public-query fixture was executed on Linux ARM64 with the pinned DuckDB
`v2.0.0-dev84020`, disposable PostgreSQL, and MinIO on 2026-09-20 via
`./scripts/check integration`. The same two-row catalog and read token produced
cold HEAD=3, full GET=3, 8,348 bytes, 401ms and warm HEAD=3, full GET=3, 8,348
bytes, 86ms. These are correctness-fixture observations, not sustained SLO or
production-cache claims; G07 retains the representative load/resource gate.

## Release and workflow

Commit reviewed changes directly to main and push after relevant checks. Current
pre-push runs Go unit/layout/architecture checks. Historical Rust deployment
staging/activation scripts are not present and must not be reported as active.
No production deployment follows from a successful development push.

G08 requires tested schema/format compatibility, real AWS and supported self-host
restore, ARM64 image provenance, secret/license scans and operational runbooks.
Unknown schema versions/gaps/checksum drift fail before migration. Journal readers
reject unknown versions. A development Down migration does not prove safe live
downgrade. Backup restore verifies PG base/WAL plus all referenced S3 objects;
never adopt newer unreferenced objects or expose partial restoration as healthy.
